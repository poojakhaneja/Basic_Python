what is recurssion fun and how it is different from other functions
make a program for factorial function using recurssion function

  2) a+b/c*(d/2)+(3*3)-6

use this eqution , using by defining different function for each diff mathematical operation.

def add (a,b)
    c=a+b
    return c

def mul

# def mul(a):
#     c=a*a
#     return c


# z=add(5,2)
# y=mul(z)
# print(y)
